# Automated Circuit Analysis for Linear Circuit Components

Got a circuit made up of components whose V-I curve is a sweet straight line? Then you can easily construct and solve a system of linear equations to find the voltage or current at each node. That's what I wanted to do. Drawing inspo from SPICE-y methods, I built this code to solve circuits made up of linear components. More coming soon!
